We have collected some of the experiences and outcomes here.
Prior experiences Hedonia (Research group, Aarhus and Oxford) Name: Camilla Eva Andersen Contact: CamEvaAndersen@gmail.com How did you get your internship?
I worked on a project in the same group as an RA.
What was your \u0026lsquo;job role\u0026rsquo;?
Researcher
What did you end up doing/creating?
Researching Cluster possibilities in R and python.
What do you wish you knew before the internship process?
That Corona would force me to work from home for a lot of the time. Probably would not have changed anything though.
What was your general experience?
The internship was generally a great experience. I got to manage my self and my time a lot of the time. This worked great when I could be in the office, but when I was at home due to corona, it was a lot more difficult to get stuff done. I learned a lot and had a lot of time to investigate something very specific. Also my coworkers are really nice and helpful.
SAS \u0026#43; IMC Name: Kenneth Enevoldsen Contact: kenneth.enevoldsen@cas.au.dk How did you get your internship?
teacher reference (SAS) and phd (IMC)
What was your \u0026lsquo;job role\u0026rsquo;?
consultant (SAS) + phd student (IMC)
What did you end up doing/creating?
sota danish sentiment analysis (SAS) and would have done application and customer implemtation if not for phd, where I did HPC Pipeline construction
What do you wish you knew before the internship process?
I really feel any lack of knowledge I had was due to uncertainty from covid so feel any answer here would not transfer
What was your general experience?
I have a broken hand so you get 1 ;) - general experience with SAS was very positive. Good environment and great help was present when needed.
Theoretical Neurobiology Group, UCL, London Name: Peter Thestrup Waade Contact: peter@waade.net How did you get your internship?
Micah Allen, who is related to the TNB in UCL, put me in contact with them and suggested I come by. I was very lucky to know him, and that he would set up the contact. It didn\u0026rsquo;t cost a lot for the TNB given that the internship was online.
What was your \u0026lsquo;job role\u0026rsquo;?
I was doing an independent research project with guidance from Karl Friston and the rest of the group attending the TNB meetings.
What did you end up doing/creating?
A simulation project looking at active inference on individual and group levels.
What do you wish you knew before the internship process?
That COVID stopped me from going and being abroad instead. And that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t use my office in Aarhus - it was tough be home so much. I should\u0026rsquo;ve started coming to university to work more.
What was your general experience?
It has been amazing to be part of the TNB meetings - something super cool every week. It has been difficult - lots of unfamiliar mathematics and technical things to learn! - but incredibly inspiring as well. Also amazing to be able to work with some of these really cool people, and it has definitely given me both some insight into academic work there, and some connections to some people I am very glad to know.
SODAS at Copenhagen University (center for social data science) Name: Christoffer Contact: christoffer@clolesen.com How did you get your internship?
Wrote an email and asked if I could be an intern
What was your \u0026lsquo;job role\u0026rsquo;?
Researcher
What did you end up doing/creating?
I was collaborating on a research project and learned a lot about the process of actually publishing research and doing pre-registration.
What do you wish you knew before the internship process?
What the content of the research I was going to do was.
What was your general experience?
I got to work on a project I didn\u0026rsquo;t find particularly interesting, which resulted in a somewhat lack of motivation (also amplified by having to work alone at home due the whole corona situation). The people at SODAS was nice and helpful, but also less invested in the project I was on, through out the most of the semester. So I was pretty much left to myself with a project i wasn\u0026rsquo;t motivated to do. That often felt like a bad experience, but I do think i learned a lot from it in the end.
Mindway AI Name: Simon Anneberg Merrild Hansen Contact: simonamhansen@hotmail.com How did you get your internship?
Through Josh. Did some related stuff for my bachelor thesis.
What was your \u0026lsquo;job role\u0026rsquo;?
Very broad but gennerally based on research \u0026amp; data analysis
What did you end up doing/creating?
Rating manual for evaluating gambling data, scientific article, product testing and development, litterature reviews, LinkedIn post etc.
What was your general experience?
An internship was a great way of trying out my skills in a business context. Just grabbing the opportunity and the tasks that I thought was relevant worked really well for me!
Hoffman-La Roche (Switzerland) Name: Lasse Hansen Contact: lasseh0310@gmail.com How did you get your internship?
Through bachelor thesis supervisor\u0026rsquo;s contacts
What was your \u0026lsquo;job role\u0026rsquo;?
Data scientist
What did you end up doing/creating?
A research project on voice changes in depression: how good models can we create; what are the possibilities/challenges before clinical integration is possible
What do you wish you knew before the internship process?
I think most things were fairly clear. Would\u0026rsquo;ve mainly wished there was less corona..
What was your general experience?
Extremely positive. Was a great way to see what it\u0026rsquo;s actually like to work in a company doing the type of work I\u0026rsquo;m considering doing afterwards. There was great opportunity for mentorship/supervision: Hour long 1-on-1 session with supervisors has been invaluable and taught me a lot.

Data science Swirlstats Instructor: Nick Carchedi Link: \u0026lt;https://swirlstats.com/ Price: \$0 swirl teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console! Intro to Git and Github Instructor: Google Publisher: Coursera Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github/home/welcome Price: \$49 Time: 5 hours / week, 4 weeks, 20 hours, 1 ECTS In this course, you’ll learn how to keep track of the different versions of your code and configuration files using a popular version control system (VCS) called Git. We\u0026rsquo;ll also go through how to setup an account with a service called GitHub so that you can create your very own remote repositories to store your code and configuration.
Throughout this course, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn about Git\u0026rsquo;s core functionality so you can understand how and why it’s used in organizations. We’ll look into both basic and more advanced features, like branches and merging. We\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate how having a working knowledge of a VCS like Git can be a lifesaver in emergency situations or when debugging. And then we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to use a VCS to work with others through remote repositories, like the ones provided by GitHub.
By the end of this course, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to store your code\u0026rsquo;s history in Git and collaborate with others in GitHub, where you’ll also start creating your own portfolio!
In order to follow along and complete the assessments, you’ll need a computer where you can install Git or ask your administrator to install it for you.
Statistical Inferences Instructor: Eindhoven University of Technology Publisher: Coursera Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences Price: \$49 Time: 2-4 hours / week, 8 weeks, 26 hours, 1 ECTS This course aims to help you to draw better statistical inferences from empirical research. First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.
In practical, hands on assignments, you will learn how to simulate t-tests to learn which p-values you can expect, calculate likelihood ratio\u0026rsquo;s and get an introduction the binomial Bayesian statistics, and learn about the positive predictive value which expresses the probability published research findings are true. We will experience the problems with optional stopping and learn how to prevent these problems by using sequential analyses. You will calculate effect sizes, see how confidence intervals work through simulations, and practice doing a-priori power analyses. Finally, you will learn how to examine whether the null hypothesis is true using equivalence testing and Bayesian statistics, and how to pre-register a study, and share your data on the Open Science Framework.

This course explores these questions and others. It is a thorough, rigorous introduction to contemporary philosophy of mind.
According to many scientists and philosophers, explaining the nature of consciousness is the deepest intellectual challenge of all. If you find consciousness at all puzzling, this is a great place to start learning more.
Automata Theory Instructor: Stanford Publisher: EdX Link: https://www.edx.org/course/automata-theory Price: \$129 Automata TheoryTime: 5-10 hours / week, 7 weeks, 70 hours, 2.5 ECTS We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the so-called \u0026ldquo;regular languages.\u0026rdquo; Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining mechanisms. We also look at closure properties of the regular languages, e.g., the fact that the union of two regular languages is also a regular language. We consider decision properties of regular languages, e.g., the fact that there is an algorithm to tell whether or not the language defined by two finite automata are the same language. Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages \u0026ndash; a way of proving that certain languages are not regular languages.
Our second topic is context-free grammars and their languages. We learn about parse trees and follow a pattern similar to that for finite automata: closure properties, decision properties, and a pumping lemma for context-free languages. We also introduce the pushdown automaton, whose nondeterministic version is equivalent in language-defining power to context-free grammars.
Next, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of computing device (the so-called \u0026ldquo;recursively enumerable languages\u0026rdquo;). We shall learn how \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo; (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages. That lets us define problems to be \u0026ldquo;decidable\u0026rdquo; if their language can be defined by a Turing machine and \u0026ldquo;undecidable\u0026rdquo; if not. We shall see some basic undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of two context-free languages is empty.
Last, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that, while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms. A common example of an NP-complete problem is SAT, the question of whether a Boolean expression has a truth-assignment to its variables that makes the expression itself true.

Global Health Informatics \u0026hellip;to Improve Quality of Care Instructor: MIT Courseware (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Publisher: EdX Link: https://www.edx.org/course/global-health-informatics-to-improve-quality-of-ca Price: \$49 Time: 2-3 hours / week, 13 weeks, 39 hours, 1.5 ECTS Disease has no respect for country borders and increased global travel has fueled the spread of infectious disease, as evidenced by the Ebola virus epidemic. Chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, initially confined to the developed world, now exist side by side with malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Global warming is widening the endemicity of vector-borne diseases.
In this course, we will explore ways to leverage information technology to combat disease and promote health, especially in resource-constrained settings. Technology is a driving force that sweeps across nations even faster than disease and with the spread of mobile phones, which bring computational power and data to our fingertips, new paradigms in tracking and battling disease have been discovered.
This course will explore innovations in information systems in developing countries, and focus not only on the importance of technology, but also on broader issues necessary for its success, such as quality improvement, project management, and leadership skills. Ultimately, health care delivery systems require fundamental and sound operations, such as physical infrastructure and supply-chain management, to deliver high-quality care. Technology is simply a tool to help facilitate this process.
The quality of care theme is critical to this course. The first step stakeholders in health systems should focus on prior to introducing an innovation is to establish a culture of quality improvement and patient safety. An information system can then play a facilitative role by enabling care coordination, tracking processes and outcomes, informing decision making, and fostering learning through data analysis.
An information system without an accompanying organizational transformation risks reinforcing the same failed processes. Using technology to improve access to care without any other quality improvement elements will yield the same and not necessarily better results, but more of them. Innovations need to address gaps in quality and demonstrate improvement in health outcomes, otherwise they won’t sustain or scale.
Lastly, we will discuss our attempts to leverage troves of data to define best practice and how we must keep the patient perspective and health at the center of everything we do.
This course is targeted toward individuals interested in designing or implementing a health information and communication technology (ICT) solution in the developing world. Implementing a health information technology project requires mulTimeisciplinary teams. Thus, with this course, we hope to bring together individuals from a variety of disciplines—computer science, medicine, engineering, public health, policy, and business.

By Kenneth C Enevoldsen, Lasse Hansen
2017
Language-Works
Traditionally, the evaluation of political biases in Danish newspapers has been carried out through highly subjective methods. The conventional approach has been surveys asking samples of the population to place various newspapers on the political spectrum, coupled with analysing voting habits of the newspapers’ readers (Hjarvard, 2007). This paper seeks to examine whether it is possible to use sentiment analysis to objectively assess political biases in Danish newspapers. By using the sentiment dictionary AFINN (Nielsen et al., 2011), the mean sentiment scores for 360 articles was calculated. The articles were published in the Danish newspapers Berlingske and Information and were all regarding the political parties Alternativet and Liberal Alliance. A significant interaction effect between the parties and newspapers was discovered. This effect was mainly driven by Information’s coverage of the two parties. Moreover, Berlingske was found to publish a disproportionately greater number of articles concerning Liberal Alliance than Alternativet. Based on these findings, an integration of sentiment analysis into the evaluation of biases in news outlets is proposed. Furthermore, future studies are suggested to construct datasets for evaluation of AFINN on news and to utilize web-mining methods to gather greater amounts of data in order to analyse more parties and newspapers.
Emotional Metacognition: Stimulus Valence Modulates Cardiac Arousal and Metamemory Link
By Sebastian Scott Engen
2020
Cognition and Emotion
Emotion alters how we feel, see, and experience the world. In the domain of memory, the emotional valence and arousal of memorized stimuli can modulate both the acuity and content of episodic recall. However, no experiment has investigated whether arousal and valence also influence metacognition for memory (i.e., the process of self-monitoring memories). In a pre-registered study, we applied a novel psychophysiological design together with computational models of metacognition to assess the influence of stimulus valence and arousal on the sensitivity, bias, and efficiency of metamemory. To estimate the role of physiological arousal in mediating these effects, we recorded cardiac measures through pulse oximetry. We found that negative valence globally and substantially decreased both memory performance and subjective confidence, in particular for low-arousal words. Simultaneously, we found that emotional valence modulated both heart rate and heart-rate variability (HRV), indicating a robust effect of negative valence on physiological arousal during recognition memory. Exploratory trial-level analyses further revealed that subjective confidence was encoded in instantaneous heart-rate fluctuations, and that this relationship was modulated by emotional valence. Our results demonstrate that both recognition memory and metacognition are influenced by the emotional contents of encoded items and that this correlation is in part related to cardiac activity.
Sentida: A New Tool for Sentiment Analysis in Danish Link
By Gustav Aarup Lauridsen, Jacob Aarup Dalsgaard, and Lars Kjartan Bacher Svendsen
2019
Language-Works
In the midst of the Era of Big Data, tools for analysing and processing unstructured data are needed more than ever. Being among these, sentiment analysis has experienced both a substantial proliferation in popularity and major developmental progress. However, the development of sentiment analysis tools in Danish has not experienced the same rapid development as e.g. English tools. Few Danish tools exist, and often the ones available are either ineffective or outdated. Moreover, authoritative validation tests in low-resource languages, are missing, which is why little can be deduced about the competence of current Danish models. We present SENTIDA, a simple and effective model for general sentiment analysis in Danish, and compare its competence to the current benchmark within the field of Danish sentiment analysis, AFINN. Combining a lexical approach with several incorporated functions, we construct SENTIDA and categorise it as a domain-independent sentiment analysis tool focusing on polarity strength. Subsequently, we run different validation tests, including a binary classification test of Trustpilot reviews and a correlation test based on manually rated texts from different domains. The results show that SENTIDA excels across all tests, predicting reviews with an accuracy above 80% in all trials and providing significant correlations with manually annotated texts.
tomsup: An implementation of computational Theory of Mind in Python Link
By Kenneth C Enevoldsen, Peter Thestrup Waade
2020/3/12
PsyArXiv
Computational implementations of Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others, has been used to investigate a variety of issues. This includes the effect of framing effects on, or inter-species differences in, ability to do ToM (Devaine et al., 2014a, 2017), ToM in autists (d’Arc et al., 2018), or providing an explanation for the apparent limits on human ability to do ToM recursively (Devaine et al., 2014b). It has been implemented in the VBA package for Matlab (Daunizeau et al., 2014), but not in any free and open-source software. Therefore this thesis presents the Theory of Mind simulation using Python (tomsup) package. The tomsup package provides accessible tools for running agent-based models in a game theory context, and allows the implementation of a computational model of ToM, either in agent-based models or in interaction with a human player. The implementation of the ToM model was originally proposed by Yoshida et al. (2008), and was developed by drawing on the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010) to its current form as it is in Devaine et al. (2017), where it is generalized to any 2-player game which can be operationalized as a 2-by-2 payoff matrix. Importantly, the ToM implementation introduces a sophistication level k, which determines how many recursive simulations of its opponent it can perform, hereby assuming bounded rationality (Kahneman, 2003). An agent using the ToM model, denoted as k-ToM, uses a variational Bayes Laplace approximation (Daunizeau, 2017b) on a turn-by-turn basis to infer its opponent’s model parameters and sophistication level, based on which it predicts the opponent’s choice and acts accordingly. An agent-based model simulation using the competitive matching pennies game was done to perform a preliminary investigation of the behaviour of the k-ToM model. Most importantly, it was found that k-ToM’s prior beliefs about its opponent have a notable effect on its performance, even over many trials, warranting further research into how its priors should be formed. Various ways are suggested in which the tomsup package and the k-ToM model could be applied and developed further, as well as a discussion on how to make it broadly available, so as to scaffold future research using computational ToM models.
Confucian Free Energy: The Predictive Mind in Ancient China Link
By Peter Thestrup Waade
2020/3/12
PsyArXiv
Roger Ames presents an interpretation of the classic Confucian philosophy where the world is seen as an always ongoing, radically interrelational, holistic process best described in terms of focus and field. Without any permanent ground truth, its inhabitants must be action-oriented way-makers: irreducibly social optimizers, and contextual co-creators, of their shared cosmos. Meanwhile, a pragmatic turn is happening in the cognitive sciences, instantiated in a new and ambitious theoretical framework: Karl Friston’s free energy principle, which aims to be a unifying paradigm for the sciences of brain, life and mind. Based on first principles from statistical physics, it describes humans - and self-organizing systems in general - as continually modelling and predicting the world. The full spectrum of human cognition and behavior is then generated by a single mechanism: the minimization of the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs. Although still controversial, the free energy principle is gaining traction within robotics, biology, neuroscience, psychology, social sciences and philosophy of mind. I here compare these two worldviews from so vastly different backgrounds, and find, perhaps surprisingly, that they in many respects are immediately compatible. Social co-creativity across spatio-temporal scales, contextualization, action-orientation and the Confucian virtues naturally translate to or integrate with free energy principle terms. Even when in seeming disagreement, for example on the question of the appearance/reality dichotomy, or that of reductive materialism which often separates the sciences and humanities in general, the two frameworks seem able to positively inform or nuance each other. This multidisciplinary comparison is interesting because it can potentially inform or guide the two theories, and address recent critiques of Ames, and as a proof of concept that bridges can be built across times, cultures and academic traditions
SEIZ Matters: Modelling the spread of concepts on Twitter Link
By Jonathan H. Rystrøm
2020/07/03
Language-Works
How do different concepts spread on social media? This question is becoming increasingly important as much of our time, discussion, and news consumption move online. This paper investigates the use of two models from epidemiology, namely the classical SI-model and the sociology-inspired SEIZ-model, to model and understand this phenomenon. I study the spread of two concepts during the 2019 Danish national election, klimatosse (climate fool) and Paludan on Twitter, both of which played key roles in the election season and had epidemic qualities in their usage throughout social media. I find that although both models can provide decent fits of the data, the SEIZ-model outperforms the SI-model by a wide margin.

A wonderful introduction to the world of Predictive Processing in an easily digestible format. If you look closer at the preface, you will also find familiar names and realise that Hohwy was a lecturer at AU in the early two-thousands.
METACOGNITIVE DIVERSITY by Joëlle Proust link
If you are interested in meta-cognition, this book presents an insightful overview over different approaches to it from an interdisciplinary angle (e.g. religion studies, developmental psychology).

Student Recommendations Sebastian Scott Engen Non-Fiction ‘LiveWired’ will invigorate your deepest desires to do CogSci research 💖 It’s a catalog of exciting anecdotes related to Brain Plasticity (or rather “livewiring”) ‘Surfaces and Essences’ is a looonnnnggggg book for the few who likes getting one idea hammered into their head with Thor’s thunder⚡ In this case, it’s that one idea is ‘Analogies are the fuel and fire of everything we hold dear’ 💗 Additionally, one of the chapters (basically a separate book) turned out being the best thing I’ve ever read on Einstein 🍬 ‘The Most Human Human’ will give you a wacky introduction to grim parts of people’s personalities by exploring just how chatbots have been built to trick us into believing they’re real humans 🥳🥳🥳🤖🥳🥳🥳 ‘How Emotions Are Made’ will give you a sensible introduction to the finetuning of emotions across cultures and wrecks a lot of outdated research in the process 🔥 In ‘The Secret To Our Success,’ one of Havard’s epic evolutionary thinkers will take you on a ride that will make you appreciate new sides of life 🌄 ‘Becoming Human’ is a beautiful introduction to Tomasello that I enjoyed while instructing the CogCom classes 🌅🌇🌅 ‘Models of the mind’ is high on my To-Read List, and so is anything by Melanie Mitchel ✨✨✨ Fiction ‘Childhood’s End’ has an intriguing take on emergence 🍀 ‘To be taught if fortunate’ will make you fall in love with anthropology 💗 It’s beautiful 💝 Esben Kran Non-Fiction How to Create a Mind Politics and the English Language Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society How to Actually Change Your Mind I Am a Strange Loop Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance The Alignment Problem by Brian Christian Blueprint for Revolution The Book of Joy Black Swan by Nassim Nicolas Taleb Fiction The Fifth Science by Exurb1a. A fantastic collection of short sci-fi stories about consciousness. Logic Beach by Exurb1a. Awesome sci-fi story of computational physics. Luke Ring Non-Fiction The Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan
A wonderful book, which is still relevant. The Demon-Haunted World discusses how prone we are as humans to misinterpret our perceptions. It\u0026rsquo;s a soft approach to scientific skepticism that doesn\u0026rsquo;t attack those who fall prey to logicial fallacies and cognitive biases, instead Sagan points out the problems and offers ways to avoid them. He has an writing style that often approaches the poetic. It\u0026rsquo;s likely you may even know a quote of his from another work \u0026ldquo;Pale Blue Dot\u0026rdquo;. Jonathan Rystrøm Non-Fiction The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism: An extremely smart of how tech companies are creating a new kind of capitalism - a must read if you want to work in tech without destroying humanity :)) Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies: The Bible of AI Safety! Bostrom takes you on a tour de force of why making AI safe is an incredibly difficult and important problem.

It will help you know to structure your document ❤ Some of you had switched around discussions and conclusions, others forgot to state their hypotheses, and so on. I believe this guide will be really helpful for a lot of you! 💗
🤘. Remember to add your names in the header, as well as page numbers. Tylen will likely print your papers, so adding these details will counteract your papers getting shuffled around in a pile 💗
🤟. Remember to cite sources when you define concepts, make bold statements, etc. In general, I would say that your focus should be less on presenting your own views and more on letting your project attach to and build on prior research 💗
🤘🤘. This website is wonderful when stress hits and you struggle to find out whether your analysis, reporting, etc. is correct: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/comparing-means-in-r 💗
🖐. When looking over your paper for the 3rd gazillion time, try having a look at the length of your sentences. Some are likely a bit wordy, whilst others are a bit sparse. Try to open up when you haven\u0026rsquo;t motivated why you did one thing rather than another, but also try to slim down the text when you have 3 examples saying roughly the same thing 💗

AUGO: Partner Universities Here, you can find all the universities that AU has partner deals with. Search for University Wide agreements instead of Lateral if you want to study other fields than Arts (e.g. data science or neuroscience). A fantastic website that is apparently getting replaced with one of highly dubious quality (let\u0026rsquo;s hope it gets updated).
It has information on all universities where AU students have gone and reviews with a lot of information on each student\u0026rsquo;s trip. You will also notice several freemovers here (see freemover section). See a Cognitive Science student\u0026rsquo;s evaluation of Vermont University here: https://arts.augo.au.dk/Institution/Evaluation/4751. They also received a grant for their exhange semester.
https://arts.augo.au.dk/Institutions
Freemover If you go to a partner university, you pay the same price as in Denmark (often free) for tuition. Then you pay for housing, food, etc. If you become a freemover (outside the partner universities) then you pay for the tuition youself as well. This can of course be done with scholarships, grants (Danish, EU, or international), etc.
An example of the process for a freemover can be seen here: https://arts.augo.au.dk/Institution/Evaluation/1773. This BSS student applied for Berkeley.

--- title: \u0026#34;Page settings\u0026#34; type: docs weight: 5 --- You do not need the page settings on every page as they default to the file name and first heading of the page.
Possible page settings code description title: \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; The title of the page in the left-hand menu type: docs Set the page type to blog or something else if it\u0026rsquo;s outside the docs weight: 4 Decides how far down it is compared to pages on the same hierarchy in the menu. The more weight, the farther down. bookFlatSection: true Shows all of its sub-pages in the menu and makes this page bold. Generally not desirable. bookCollapseSection: true Creates an expandable menu item. All sections are currently configured like this. bookHidden: true Hides the page in the menu. bookToC: false Hides the right-side table of contents. bookComments: true Shows comments on the page.

This is extremely useful. Some usage examples are shown on the link.\nText basics Writing text and clicking enter to get to the next line just continues your current line. If you write two spaces at the end of the line and click enter, it becomes a new line.\nHowever, to get a new paragraph like I just did, you have to leave a whole empty line between this text and the previous.\nHeadings You write headings from level 1 to 6 (size and hierarchy) by preceding these headings with the pound (#) symbol X amount of times:\n# Title of my blog post\n## A heading 2 in my blog post\n### And, wow, a heading 3!\nThese headings show up in the right hand menu.\nNormal formatting Additionally, there\u0026rsquo;s these normal awesome text formatting things:\nThis is italicized This is phatt** This is crossed out Oh my, there\u0026rsquo;s also a list in the middle of it all Sub points 2 spaces in with checkmarks! These are written as such:\n\\- \\[ \\] \\*This is italicized\\* \\- \\[ \\] \\*\\*This is phatt\\*\\* \\- \\[ \\] \\~\\~This is crossed out\\~\\~ \\- \\[ \\] Oh my, there\u0026#39;s also a list in the middle of it all \\- \\[ \\] Sub points 2 spaces in \\- \\[x\\] with checkmarks! Ordered list:\n\\1 Text \\2 Text \\3 Text I might want to write other stuff as well. Maybe even a link to some cool stuff by writing [text](link). To quickly create links from URLs like this https://gitlab.com/aucogseers/CogSite, write \u0026lt;https://gitlab.com/aucogseers/CogSite\u0026gt;. You can also reference other sections on the post by referring to their titles like this: Writing in markdown [Writing in markdown](#writing-in-markdown)\nYou might also want an image like this in your post:\nYou can get this by writing ![Text shown if image doesn\u0026rsquo;t load](/posts/your-blog-post/link-to-image.jpg).\nYou can see how these characters are used by the formatting (*, [], ()). If you want to use them without affecting formatting, just but a backslash in front of the symbol as such: \\*, \\[\\], \\(\\).\nTo create a line like this\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;write either ***, --- or ________. The output will look the same. And remember to put blank lines before and after the line.\nSpecial text formatting I can write in-line code like this in-line code by writing `in-line code` and create a code block like this\u0026hellip;\n# This is a code block WriteBlogPost(new DateTime(DateTime.now())); \u0026hellip;by writing it like this:\n```javascript // Put your javascript code here // Replace the \u0026ldquo;javascript\u0026rdquo; tag with another language (like \u0026ldquo;python\u0026rdquo;) and it will create syntax highlighting ```\nQuotes like this\u0026hellip;\nThis is a multi-line quote text\n\u0026hellip;are written like this:\n\\\u0026gt; This is a multi-line \\\u0026gt; quote text Emojis You can write emojis like these:\nSmiley Code :innocent: :innocent: :star_struck: :star_struck: See more smiley codes here.\nAdvanced structure formatting You can write a table like this\u0026hellip;\nFirst row item Another one! This is some content, though Even more! When will it stop? \u0026hellip;by writing:\n\\| First row item | Another one! | \\| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | \\| This is some content, though | Even more!

Markdown is an established way to write with formatting. You can find instructions on how to write it on this page.
The name of the file has to be in the following syntax: **my-blog-post.md with dashes instead of spaces and in all lower-case. This ensures that we can link between pages optimally.
By following this guide, you have access to the file structure of the website. Here you will place your .md file in the in the /content/posts/ folder. Any content you wish to reference that is not online (like images and files) must be placed in the /static/posts/my-blog-post/ folder. Then you make references to them in your markdown text by writing the link as ../posts/my-blog-post/my-image.jpg (see an example of using images in your blog post on the markdown page).
Blog post settings The blog post settings are important to show your blog post as you want it in The Attention Spotlight. You write them in the top of your .md blog post file. For example:
--- author: \u0026#34;Author name\u0026#34; date: 2020-05-05 title: This is a blog post next: /next-blog-post-file-name prev: /previous-blog-post-file-name categories: [\u0026#39;Category\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Another Category\u0026#39;] tags: [\u0026#39;Tag\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Another Tag\u0026#39;] bookHidden: true --- Author, date, and title make good sense. The next and prev are the blog posts that get linked to at the bottom of this specific blog post. They are not necessary. The categories and tags are already mostly well-defined in the blog section (and are visible as filters on The Attention Spotlight). If you feel like we need to add another one, contact us. bookHidden means that the blog post will not show up in the left menu.
Finishing up When you are finished writing the .md file, putting it in the correct directory, putting the associated files in the relevant directory in the static folder, and you are ready to share your post with the world, you can follow these instructions to create a pull request. Then your blog post will be reviewed and accepted in The Attention Spotlight.

Short answer Send a pull-request on gitlab with your content in markdown format.
Slightly longer answer The website is powered by Hugo, which reads a folder full of Markdown (.md) files, and turns them into the files needed for a beautiful website (.html).
This happens automatically, so all you need to do is commit your content as a markdown file, and send in those changes.
Step-by-step answer First, fork the repository by clicking the \u0026ldquo;Fork\u0026rdquo; button in the top right on gitlab. Now you have \u0026ldquo;your version\u0026rdquo; at https://gitlab.com/\u0026lt;yourusername\u0026gt;/CogSite. Clone that, for example with git clone git@gitlab.com:\u0026lt;yourusername\u0026gt;/CogSite.git Follow the instructions on the \u0026ldquo;Writing a blog post\u0026rdquo; page or copy the example blog post file to create your own post. You can also add to existing pages\u0026rsquo;s lists and content. (Optional) Build the site locally, so you can see your changes in action before sending them live. See the main README on gitlab. When you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied, commit your changes and push them to the repository. Now go to the gitlab repository, under \u0026ldquo;Merge Requests\u0026rdquo; to the left, click \u0026ldquo;New merge request\u0026rdquo;. Make sure the \u0026ldquo;Source Branch\u0026rdquo; comes from your fork, ie \u0026lt;yourusername\u0026gt;/CogSite, and the \u0026ldquo;Target Branch\u0026rdquo; is the official aucogseers/CogSite. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve submitted your merge request, your contribution will go live as soon as someone with commit access on the project approves the merge request. If you\u0026rsquo;re a regular contributor, you can skip steps 1 and 6, and instead clone the main repository directly and push changes back live.

Welcome to the launch of cogsci.dk!
Our vision with this website is that we can have a shared space across the years in the bsc and msc. We think this can be part of shaping the identity of this wonderful programme we\u0026rsquo;re in.
We all have different strengths, so when we (the more website-technically-oriented bunch) create this website, it\u0026rsquo;s in the hope that those who know their ways through the bureaucracy, those with experience with industry careers, those who are good at programming or incredible with statistics, those deeply integrated in the social life, those with deep and/or broad knowledge of a literature, or just those who know where to find interesting stuff to read and watch \u0026ndash; we hope that all of you will contribute your strengths to make this a great shared resource.
You can already find on here: Inspiration and experience from studying abroad, or getting better at programming. Social activity clubs operating across the years. A curated list of learning materials, free and paid. Exam projects, publications, and CogTalks by students You will help build this site In the very near future, the section with examples of former exam projects will be filled out. We hope to see yours too! more on that in a future blog post. We hope that when you come across some interesting content, you will share it not only with your own study group or semester, but file it on cogsci.dk as well so it can be enjoyed across the whole studies. If you are holding a cool event (ie CogTalks), arranging the next big party (shoutout to Broca\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; we\u0026rsquo;ll be patient), or have other social or societal things to take up with all of CogSci (making a website ? ) \u0026mdash; Why not put it on here? The blog is open to anything CogSci-related! When you see a blank page, broken link, or just a page that could be even better, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to fix it! If you send us a pull request (we made a nice guide here, otherwise ask) Right now, the website is edited by a do-ocratic team of those willing to do the work. In the future, editorial control will be passed on to a democratic process in the up-and-coming CogSci Student Council.
OBS: We\u0026rsquo;re still under construction \u0026hellip; and we\u0026rsquo;re serious about your participation!

The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model of this is goodness ~ semester + num_broca_parties * num_lockdowns + (1|year) (10-fold repeated cross-validation). This disclaimer is not meant to degrade papers from earlier semesters (that are most likely awesome (our model has a high intercept)) but just an honest note that we all get drastically better with time, and we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of sharing our imperfect work. Science is difficult y\u0026rsquo;all!
Note that courses may be renamed or moved to different semesters. Older papers may not fit the current course requirements / topics, so perhaps change the title before handing them in!

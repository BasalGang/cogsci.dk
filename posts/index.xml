Welcome to the launch of cogsci.dk!
Our vision with this website is that we can have a shared space across the years in the bsc and msc. We think this can be part of shaping the identity of this wonderful programme we&amp;rsquo;re in.
We all have different strengths, so when we (the more website-technically-oriented bunch) create this website, it&amp;rsquo;s in the hope that those who know their ways through the bureaucracy, those with experience with industry careers, those who are good at programming or incredible with statistics, those deeply integrated in the social life, those with deep and/or broad knowledge of a literature, or just those who know where to find interesting stuff to read and watch &amp;ndash; we hope that all of you will contribute your strengths to make this a great shared resource.</description>

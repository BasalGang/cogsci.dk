# CogSite

Content for the Website of Cognitive Science Students at Aarhus University.

## ANNOUNCEMENTS

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

You can host the site locally by running the HostSiteLocally.Rmd, after what, you can
edit the website's content and see all changes made dynamically. Additionally, you
can download `hugo-extended` with `choco install hugo-extended` if you have
`chocolatey` downloaded. Then it's possible to use `hugo server` in the root
folder and the website is hosted on port 1313 (by default).

## Current state

The technical elements are basically finished. The basic architecture is ready.

Some sub-pages under "reinforced learning" and "the data frame" still needs to
be created but beyond that, they are mostly created (from the CogSite SideStruktur document)

## How to build the site locally

1. Clone this reposititory, `git clone git@gitlab.com:AUcogseers/CogSite.git`
2. In the newly cloned folder (`cd CogSite`), download the theme with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Download the hugo files from within R with `blogdown::install_hugo()`
4. Build the webpages in R with `blogdown::build_site()`
5. Optionally, host a local webserver with `blogdown::serve_site()` and take it back down with `servr::daemon_stop(1)`

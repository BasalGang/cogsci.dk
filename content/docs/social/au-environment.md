## Research groups
### Daina Crafa Lab
Her research investigates the effects of culture and social contexts on human development, brain processes, and genetics.
https://www.dainacrafa.com/

### Dandrite
The focus of DANDRITE research are on molecular mechanisms that explain physiological manifestations of cellular communication networks in brain circuitries, and how these are affected in neurological and psychiatric disorders.
https://dandrite.au.dk/

### iPSYCH
iPSYCH is studying five specific mental disorders; autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. All disorders are associated with major human and societal costs all over the world. The iPSYCH project will study these disorders from many different angles, ranging from genes and cells to population studies, from fetus to adult, from cause to symptoms of the disorder, and this knowledge will be combined in new ways across scientific fields.

### Translational Neuropsychiatry Unit
TNU carries out translational neuropsychiatric research, particularly focusing on human and animal experimental studies.
https://tnu.au.dk/

### Plasticity and Disease
They use cutting-edge techniques as Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of patients suffering from brain diseases as Stroke and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

### Pre-clinical Optical Group
They engage  in interdisciplinary preclinical research with the overall goal to understand and quantify capillary dysfunction in various age-related disorders including ischemic stroke and reperfusion injuries, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and diabetic neuropathy.

What are models? Why should we absolutely use them, whenever doing serious thinking? Why should we absolutely distrust them and pitch them against each other?

Sometimes a correlation does imply causation. When, how, WTF? A little book with exercises trying to guide you through causal inference issues in a meta-statistical way: causality can be found in statistical models given the assumptions you make about the underlying mechanisms.

- ‘How Emotions Are Made’ will give you a sensible introduction to the finetuning of emotions across cultures and wrecks a lot of outdated research in the process 🔥
- In ‘The Secret To Our Success,’ one of Havard’s epic evolutionary thinkers will take you on a ride that will make you appreciate new sides of life 🌄
- ‘Becoming Human’ is a beautiful introduction to Tomasello that I enjoyed while instructing the CogCom classes 🌅🌇🌅

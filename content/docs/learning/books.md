This book by Eilenberger is a well researched narrative about four influential thinkers (Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Cassirer and Heidegger) and their lives and philosophies. Interesting background and links. For example, did you know that Heidegger and Hannah Arendt were a couple?

### The model thinker

Sometimes a correlation does imply causation. When, how, WTF? A little book with exercises trying to guide you through causal inference issues in a meta-statistical way: causality can be found in statistical models given the assumptions you make about the underlying mechanisms.

![Book cover for Carl Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World"](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553691804l/17349._SX318_.jpg)

[The Demon-Haunted World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World) by Carl Sagan

A wonderful book, which is still relevant. The Demon-Haunted World discusses how prone we are as humans to misinterpret our perceptions. It's a soft approach to scientific skepticism that doesn't attack those who fall prey to logicial fallacies and cognitive biases, instead Sagan points out the problems and offers ways to avoid them. He has an writing style that often approaches the poetic. It's likely you may even know a quote of his from another work "Pale Blue Dot".

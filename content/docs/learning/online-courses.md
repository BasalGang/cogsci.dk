- Publisher: [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)
- Link: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github/home/welcome>
- Price: \$49
- Time: 5 hours / week, 4 weeks, 20 hours, 1 ECTS

In this course, you’ll learn how to keep track of the different versions of your code
and configuration files using a popular version control system (VCS) called Git.
We'll also go through how to setup an account with a service called GitHub so that
you can create your very own remote repositories to store your code and configuration.

Throughout this course, you'll learn about Git's core functionality so you can
understand how and why it’s used in organizations. We’ll look into both basic
and more advanced features, like branches and merging. We'll demonstrate
how having a working knowledge of a VCS like Git can be a lifesaver in emergency
situations or when debugging. And then we'll explore how to use a VCS to work with
others through remote repositories, like the ones provided by GitHub.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to store your code's history in Git
and collaborate with others in GitHub, where you’ll also start creating your own portfolio!

In order to follow along and complete the assessments, you’ll need a computer
where you can install Git or ask your administrator to install it for you.

{{< details title="Statistical Inferences" open=false >}}

- Instructor: [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/)
- Publisher: [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)
- Link: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences>
- Price: \$49
- Time: 2-4 hours / week, 8 weeks, 26 hours, 1 ECTS

This course aims to help you to draw better statistical inferences from empirical research.
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals,
Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions
you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false
positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for
example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to
interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for
example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy
of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication
studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following
Open Science principles.

In practical, hands on assignments, you will learn how to simulate t-tests to learn which
p-values you can expect, calculate likelihood ratio's and get an introduction the binomial
Bayesian statistics, and learn about the positive predictive value which expresses the
probability published research findings are true. We will experience the problems with optional
stopping and learn how to prevent these problems by using sequential analyses. You will
calculate effect sizes, see how confidence intervals work through simulations, and practice
doing a-priori power analyses. Finally, you will learn how to examine whether the null hypothesis
is true using equivalence testing and Bayesian statistics, and how to pre-register a study,
and share your data on the Open Science Framework.

programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and
implementation. Problem sets requiring R programming will be used to test understanding
and ability to implement basic data analyses. We will use visualization techniques to
explore new data sets and determine the most appropriate approach. We will describe robust
statistical techniques as alternatives when data do not fit assumptions required by the
standard approaches. By using R scripts to analyze data, you will learn the basics of
conducting reproducible research.

Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the course
materials into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest
you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses,
similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology
lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty
relatively quickly across the first three courses. We start with simple calculations and
descriptive statistics. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such
as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a
vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so
pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing
it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards
human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine
learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to
work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical
underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to
quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll
learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains
to machine learning and AI.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and
statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
(parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural
networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction,
recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning
(bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The
course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that
you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots
(perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer
vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

- Price: \$129
- [Automata Theory](https://www.edx.org/course/automata-theory)Time: 5-10
  hours / week, 7 weeks, 70 hours, 2.5 ECTS

We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the
so-called "regular languages." Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic
automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining
mechanisms. We also look at closure properties of the regular languages, e.g.,
the fact that the union of two regular languages is also a regular language. We
consider decision properties of regular languages, e.g., the fact that there is
an algorithm to tell whether or not the language defined by two finite automata
are the same language. Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages
-- a way of proving that certain languages are not regular languages.

Our second topic is context-free grammars and their languages. We learn about
parse trees and follow a pattern similar to that for finite automata: closure
properties, decision properties, and a pumping lemma for context-free languages.
We also introduce the pushdown automaton, whose nondeterministic version is
equivalent in language-defining power to context-free grammars.

Next, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all
the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of
computing device (the so-called "recursively enumerable languages"). We shall
learn how "problems" (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages.
That lets us define problems to be "decidable" if their language can be defined
by a Turing machine and "undecidable" if not. We shall see some basic
undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of
two context-free languages is empty.

Last, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that,
while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time
less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the
NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes
many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or
even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all
of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms. A common example of an
NP-complete problem is SAT, the question of whether a Boolean expression has a
truth-assignment to its variables that makes the expression itself true.

fueled the spread of infectious disease, as evidenced by the Ebola virus
epidemic. Chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, initially
confined to the developed world, now exist side by side with malnutrition in
low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Global warming is widening the
endemicity of vector-borne diseases.

In this course, we will explore ways to leverage information technology to
combat disease and promote health, especially in resource-constrained settings.
Technology is a driving force that sweeps across nations even faster than
disease and with the spread of mobile phones, which bring computational power
and data to our fingertips, new paradigms in tracking and battling disease have
been discovered.

This course will explore innovations in information systems in developing
countries, and focus not only on the importance of technology, but also on
broader issues necessary for its success, such as quality improvement, project
management, and leadership skills. Ultimately, health care delivery systems
require fundamental and sound operations, such as physical infrastructure and
supply-chain management, to deliver high-quality care. Technology is simply a
tool to help facilitate this process.

The quality of care theme is critical to this course. The first step
stakeholders in health systems should focus on prior to introducing an
innovation is to establish a culture of quality improvement and patient safety.
An information system can then play a facilitative role by enabling care
coordination, tracking processes and outcomes, informing decision making, and
fostering learning through data analysis.

An information system without an accompanying organizational transformation
risks reinforcing the same failed processes. Using technology to improve access
to care without any other quality improvement elements will yield the same and
not necessarily better results, but more of them. Innovations need to address
gaps in quality and demonstrate improvement in health outcomes, otherwise they
won’t sustain or scale.

Lastly, we will discuss our attempts to leverage troves of data to define best
practice and how we must keep the patient perspective and health at the center
of everything we do.

This course is targeted toward individuals interested in designing or
implementing a health information and communication technology (ICT) solution in
the developing world. Implementing a health information technology project
requires mulTimeisciplinary teams. Thus, with this course, we hope to bring
together individuals from a variety of disciplines—computer science, medicine,
engineering, public health, policy, and business.

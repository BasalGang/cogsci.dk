# The Predictive Mind by Jakob Hohwy
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18012311-the-predictive-mind
A wonderful introduction to the world of Predictive Processing in an easily digestible format. If you look closer at the preface, you will also find familiar names and realise that Hohwy was a lecturer at AU in the early two-thousands.

# Extra
Time of the Magicians / Zeit der Zauberer by Wolfram Eilenberger
This book by Eilenberger is a well researched narrative about four influential thinkers (Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Cassirer and Heidegger) and their lives and philosophies. Interesting background and links. For example, did you know that Heidegger and Hannah Arendt were a couple?

# The model thinker
https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39088592
What are models? Why should we absolutely use them, whenever doing serious thinking? Why should we absolutely distrust them and pitch them against each other?

- Mitchell. Artificial Intelligence
What is all this fuzz about deep learning? What are its basic concepts? What are the strengths and deep limitations?

- Strogatz. Infinite powers
Calculus as you have never seen it. A vertiginous trip through the mind-bending discovery of infinitesimals.

{{< details title="Freemover vs. mover (?)" open=false >}}
If you go to a partner university, you pay the same price as in Denmark (often free) for tuition. Then you pay for housing, food, etc. If you become a freemover (outside the partner universities) then you pay for the tuition youself as well. This can of course be done with scholarships, grants (Danish, EU, or international), etc.

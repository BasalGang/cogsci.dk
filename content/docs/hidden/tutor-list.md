# Tutor list

This is an assembly of people who find it fun to help out with Statistics, Coding, Designing Experiments & Data Visualisation <br>
Here you can get in contact with knowledgeful Cognitive Science Students if you need help with your work. It might be for shorter consultations <br>
or for help with larger projects where you'd like to pay someone for assisting you with all the nitty-gritty details. <br>
Moreover, I've also been asked by other students to be their private tutor and this could also be a place to find such a friend :) <br>

Sign-Up below or look through the list to find yourself a tutor, programmer, statistician, web-designer or any other type of PC Pirate <br>

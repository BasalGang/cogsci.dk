1. About the degree programme
   1.1 The academic direction and primary subject areas of the programme
   The aims of the Bachelor’s degree programme in Cognitive Science are to provide the student with insight into cognitive processes such as perception and behaviour, decision-making, communication, social dynamics and consciousness with a particular focus on the latest developments within experimental and analytical methods. All the subjects focus on actual experimental projects and on the use of cognitive theory for solving problems in ‘the real world’, which will provide the student with skills that can be used in analysing and investigating a wide range of questions pertaining to human thought and behaviour.

This is a cross-disciplinary degree programme that combines in-dept academic specialisation with cross-disciplinary width. Cognitive science has developed into an independent line of research, but it draws on knowledge and procedures from other fields such as psychology, computer science, linguistics, philosophy and anthropology.

The degree programme is conducted in English. A supplementary subject (45 ECTS) is included in the Bachelor’s degree programme.

Ministerial Order no. 107 of 12 February 2018 on Admission to and Enrolment on Bachelor’s Degree Programmes at Universities (in Danish only)(https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=198310).

Aarhus University’s rules regarding degree programmes can be found in the university’s electronic rules and regulations https://international.au.dk/about/organisation/index/

3.2 Regulations for 1st year examination
The university will cancel the enrolment of all students who fail to pass the exams included in their first-year exam by the end of their first year of study. This will be done whether or not students have tried to pass this exam three times. Introductory courses are not included in the first-year exam, and the first year of study begins at the start of the first semester in which there are no non-introductory courses.
The exams included in the first-year exam are stated under point 2 of your academic regulations (“Degree programme structure”).

3.3 Regulations for commencement of studies exam
The compulsory commencement of studies exam will be held before the end of September on the first semester of the Bachelor’s degree programme.
The exam generates 0 ECTS credits and is a pass/fail internal examination with no co-examiner. Two attempts to pass this exam are allowed. First-semester students will be registered for the exam automatically. The result will be posted in the student’s self-service system (mit.au.dk). Students who do not pass their first examination attempt will be registered automatically for their second attempt.
The result of the second attempt will be posted in the student’s self-service system (mit.au.dk) no later than 28 September. Students who fail both their first and second attempt will be withdrawn from their degree programme with immediate effect and without further warning.

3.4 Credit and flexibility
Students may apply for advance approval of degree programme elements which are subsequently completed at another university or institution of higher education in Denmark or abroad. An approved application for advance approval of transfer credit obligates the student to document his or her results – both passed and failed degree programme elements, as soon as these marks are available. The board of studies may – if necessary – procure the necessary documentation directly. The student will then receive transfer credit for the passed degree programme elements.

Applications for advance approval of transfer credit and submission of documentation for completed degree programme elements with a view to registration of transfer credit must take place in accordance with the rules published on the study portal. In addition, the board of studies may approve applications for transfer credit for degree programme elements which have been completed at an institution of higher education in Denmark or abroad.

When the board of studies has approved the credit transfer of a passed course/course element from an institution of higher education in Denmark or abroad, credit must be transferred as as ‘Passed’. If the course element in question is assessed in accordance with the 7-point grading scale at both institutions, the assessment is transferred with the grade given, cf. the Degree Programme Order and the Examination Order.

3.5 Registration and withdrawal
Registration for courses, exams and elective courses
Students will be registered automatically for teaching and exams in the compulsory subjects of their degree programme in the order of semesters prescribed in the academic regulations. Students are responsible for ensuring that they are always registered correctly for courses and exams. Students are responsible for registering for and (if necessary) listing their priorities for elective courses. This must be done by the registration deadline. After the deadline for withdrawal, elective courses become a compulsory part of the student’s degree programme and cannot be changed.

Students are responsible for registering for re-examinations by the set deadline, which can be found on the study portal. Students can withdraw from exams using the self-service system at mit.au.dk, following the procedure described on the study portal. Students can only register for re-examinations if they have already tried to pass the scheduled exam before the re-examination.

Students may not withdraw from exams after the deadline for withdrawal, and the failure to take part in an exam for which they are registered will count as an attempt to pass it. The deadlines for registration and withdrawal are identical and can be found on the study portal. Students may not withdraw from their Master’s thesis.

Students who stick to the prescribed curriculum will be given priority when class places are assigned. After the deadline for registration, class places can only be assigned to students if there is room in the classroom concerned.

Forms of re-examination
Students taking exams in the re-examination period will be examined using the form of re-examination that has been specified.

If only one form of exam has been specified, students can ask to take the re-examination in the scheduled exam period. Any such request must be made before the registration deadline. Students should not expect requests submitted after this time to be considered.

If two forms of exam are specified, the first will be used for the scheduled exam and the second for the re-examination. Students can choose between the specified forms of exam for their Master’s thesis.

Requirement regarding active enrolment
The active enrolment requirement of 45 ECTS per academic year applies to all students, cf. Aarhus University’s rules of 1 September 2018: http://www.au.dk/om/organisation/regelsamling/4/41/ , which means that students must pass at least 45 ECTS credits each academic year.

3.6 Spelling and fluency
In the assessment of Bachelor’s projects and other major written assignments, emphasis must be placed on the student’s spelling and fluency in addition to his/her command of the content knowledge.

In the assessment of all written exams, emphasis will be placed on the extent to which the student is able to present an academic topic and structure an academic assignment including complying with formal academic requirements (references, quotations, etc.). In the assessment of all oral exams, emphasis is placed on the student's ability to present academic information, structure a presentation and take part in constructive academic dialogue.

3.7 Regulations for assignments
Conditions regarding the extent of written submissions are stated in the description of each degree programme component. A normal page for written submissions is 2400 characters (with spaces). To calculate normal pages, both text and notes are included, but not the front page, table of contents and bibliography. Written submissions that do not comply with these conditions cannot be accepted for assessment.

3.8 Using computers for examinations
Most written exams at AU are taken in a digital exams system. More information about digital exams may be found on the study portal. See also Aarhus University’s rules on on-site examinations.

http://www.au.dk/en/about/organisation/index/5/56/56-06-rules-on-on-site-examinations-aus-rules/

3.9 Project-oriented courses
Options for project-oriented courses are stated in the description of the individual study element.
3.10 Exemption
An exemption is a deviation from that or those regulations that normally apply for the area in question. Exemption can be granted on the basis of an application sent to the authority that has the power to grant such exemption. An application for exemption must be submitted to the Board of Studies. If another authority has the power to grant exemption, the Board of Studies forwards the application to the appro-priate authority (e.g. the dean, rector or ministry). An application for exemption must be made in writing, stating reasons, and submitted as soon as possible. For the application to be processed immediately, it must include a precise account of the regulation from which exemption is sought, and what such exemption is intended to achieve (e.g. permission to use special aids, extension of examination time, postponement of time limits). Documentation for the unusual conditions that justify exemption must be enclosed with the application. Importance will not normally be attached to such conditions if they are not documented.More information about exemptions may be found on the study portal portal.

3.11 Appeals and complaints
Complaints about exams should be submitted to the university. For the application to be processed, it must be made in writing and must account for the student’s reasons for lodging the complaint. The complaint must state both the reason for the complaint and what the complainant expects to achieve. Complaints about exams must be submitted within fourteen days after the deadline for the publication of exam results, cf. the Examination Order. More information about exam complaints is available on the study portal.
3.12 Examinations
Prerequisites
Prerequisites are demands which students must comply before taking an exam. Such prerequisites normally involve the submission and approval of a syllabus, a media product, a case, a collection of assignments or a synopsis.
The rules and deadlines for complying with prerequisites are stated on the study portal.

3.13 Exchange
A degree programme may include study abroad. More information is available on the study portal.
